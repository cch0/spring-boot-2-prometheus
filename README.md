# spring-boot-2-prometheus
Bare minimum spring boot 2 application with Prometheus

Once application is started, __Prometheus__ endpoint is available at __/actuator/prometheus__ and __metrics__ endpoint at __/actuator/metrics__.


This application is generated by [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) with additional dependency on actuator, web and devtools.

Additional maven dependency for __micrometer-registry-prometheus__ is also added so that the application is generating metrics in Prometheus format.

In the __application.yml__ file, prometheus and metrics endpoints are enabled by the following configuration.

```
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include:
          - info
          - health
          - prometheus
          - metrics
```
